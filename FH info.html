<h1>FREEHEELERS</h1>

Weekly info at <a href="http:\\www.juniornordicprogram.org">www.juniornordicprogram.org</a>
<br><br>
<font color="red">Cold Weather! Pack neck warmer, heat packs, and googles.  When it's cold, a couple plastic bags can be used to cover the gloves on the way down; much warmer!</font><br><br>
All Freeheelers are skating week 1.<br><br>
Information for Saturday morning of week 1:
<ul>
<li>#1, please let me know if your child will be out.  It really helps us plan the groups and activites, esp when we have 
instructor absences: juniornordicprogram@gmail.com</li>
<li> Make sure your child gets a good night of sleep and a hearty breakfast. </li>
<li>Show up early (8:30-9am) for the first day if you need season rentals.  If you don't need rentals, 9:15am should be fine. Any later and the parking lot is liable to fill up.</li>
<li>When you enter the Nordic Center, CHECK IN at the Junior Program registration table (it'll be obvious).  If you don't check in, your instructor assumes you did not come and might get on the lift without you.</li>
<li>If you need season rentals, head to the rentals area to pay and get sized.  
Freeheelers will both skate and classic and often the instructors decide in the morning what to do based on conditions. 
 So bring both---always.  Realistically, renting is a bit of a hassle for Freeheelers since groups might switch gear in the 
morning or mid-day (rarely).</li>
<li>Freeheelers must have their trail pass or season pass on them.  Lifties will not let them on the lift even with their instructor.  If they forgot their season pass, head to the cashier to fill out a 'forgot my pass' form.  If you haven't bought your 
child's season pass before lessons, buy a trail pass and then head to Guest Services at West or Central with their ticket 
after lessons.  You can credit the ticket price to a nordic season pass.</li>
To buy a nordic pass online, go here
<a href="http://www.summitatsnoqualmie.com/tickets-and-passes/season-passes">Season Passes</a>
and click 'Nordic' in the grey tab nav bar near the top of the page.</li>
<li>Week 2 and onward, parents and their kids head OUTSIDE at 10am for warm-up.  We'll be beside the lodge just uphill (opposite of the parking lot side).  For week 1, look for your instructor out front.</li>
<li>ALWAYS pack a lunch, including week 1.  Freeheelers will eat lunch with their group.  Maybe up top, maybe on the trail, 
maybe at the lodge.  Freeheelers are an independent bunch and ski the whole trail system.</li>
<li>Mark your child's skis and poles in a VERY obvious manner.  Most kids have similar brands and sizes.  Phone number is good too.</li>
<li>Mark your child's clothing (so we can get it back to you when/if your child misplaces it).</li>
<li>Those integrated drinking systems are great (with an insulated tube). A SMALL backpack with small water bottle works also.</li>
<li>Pack YUMMY food in your child's lunch.  We need them to eat their lunch so they have energy the whole session.  Hmm, ice 
cold PB and J on the trail? It takes a determined kid to eat that. Chewy cookies, yum!  Pack yummy stuff to drink too.  Not all 
kids will drink plain water.</li>
<li>WAX your kid's skate skis.  Seriously.  Freeheelers need waxed skis.  At the very minimum, you can get some Swix paste wax (like Swix Universal Rub-On-Fluoro 40ml F4 Paste Wax on Amazon) and rub that on before each session.  Or hot wax if you are set up for that.  </li>
<li>There are no restrooms on the trails unless the honeybucket is up at Grand Junction (not sure it is).  But there are plenty of trees.</li>
<li>'We're going to be late.  What should we do?'  We start at 10am.  We have a warm-up and then about 10:15am Freeheelers head up top.  If you miss the departure, you probably won't find them.</li>
