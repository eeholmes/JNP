<h2>The Harry Potter adventure 2013 season</h2>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Week 6, The Harry Potter Adventure</h2>
<font size="4" face="Georgia, Arial" color="maroon">
Dear Professor Holmes,<br><br>
Your team was captured by SPIDERS!  I'm so sorry.  Hagrid normally keeps Aragog's offspring under control but as Hogwarts' Keeper of the Keys, he was called by Svinvorter to help find the key to COSSOC.  It disappeared when the crypt was opened and must be found to close the crypt.  Obviously the spiders, decided that when Hagrid is away the spiders will play.  Thankfully they only wrapped your kids up in spider web and paralyzed them.  Once again your youngers saved the day!!
<br><br>
We CONVINCED the centaurs that you and Harry are not helping COSSOCOSSOC! I showed them the JOURNAL and the drawings of centaurs left by the pixies.  Now we know that the pixies were behind everything and that COSSOCOSSC used them to trick the centaurs. But we need to get rid of the pixies!  They are only trouble.  Thankfully your team found the Norwegian notes, which led you to some pixie bait.  Please use that to trap them.  The bait will turn them into sparkly rocks.
<br><br>
Hagrid reports that the Svinvorter Keeper of the Keys has been searching for the key in your world.  The word for key is "Nokkel" in Norwegian.  Hagrid doesn't think he speaks English.  The Svinvorter Keeper thinks the Order of Svarte Munker know where it is.  If you meet them, negotiate with them for information.
<br><br>
The team UP TOP is having trouble with CONSTANT VIGILANCE. They have been cursed, ambushed by centaurs and captured by spiders.  Sigh.
<br><br>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Week 5, The Harry Potter Adventure</h2>
<font size="4" face="Georgia, Arial" color="maroon">
Dear Professor Holmes,<br><br>
Sigh.  I have no idea why the centaurs thought your team was working for COSSOCOSSOC!  I'm so sorry that they attacked your party and tied them up.  That must have been quite a shock.  However once again your younger team members are up for the challenge and were able to break the enchantments from their arrows and break the enchanted ropes!
<br><br>
Harry is trying to talk with the centaurs, but they think he has something to do with the crypt being opened.  This doesn't look good.  We MUST find out why the centaurs think that we are part of COSSOCOSSOC!   With the centaurs against us, COSSOCOSSOC will have the upper hand!  Please send out your spies!  You must intercept note s and find clues for why the centaurs have turned on us!
<br><br>
Thank you for the note written in Norwegian.  I don't understand.  They are just complaining about the Cornish Pixies.  I spoke with the head of Svinworter about the house elves.  Indeed, the house elves are being pestered by the pixies so they must be extra secretive when bringing messages.  Please try to map out where the pixies are.  We will have to put out pixie traps.  Oh, good work finding the JOURNAL again.  This is our best source of clues!  
<br><br>
Rapid detection and intercepted messages is mission critical! Explore new areas! Report everything!  And ahem the team UP TOP should maintain CONSTANT VIGILANCE. Constant means, like, CONSTANT.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Week 4, The Harry Potter Adventure</h2>
<font size="4" face="Georgia, Arial" color="maroon">
Dear Professor Holmes,<br><br>
Oh dear.  I'm sorry about the children being attacked with the Imperius Curse.  Please give my apologies to the parents.  However, I am so impressed that your team members have studied spells and wand-craft and were able to successfully perform the Stupify, Expeliamos, and Abductor spells!  I confer Owls all round for that stupendous performance.  Perhaps your older team members should do some remedial training with them.    It was extremely clever of your members to decipher the candy heart message from the house elves.  "Hold Hands Forever"  Hmm, not sure what that means.   But regarding the other note  written Norwegian.  Hagrid was so relieved to find out what happened to Fluffy!  He found his way back home last Thursday on his own and ate 9 bowls of dog food with his 3 heads.  OH. THE. JOURNAL!! The team that discovered that deserves a free visit to Honeydukes!  Good idea to put it back out so we can spy.
<br><br>
I have some news on my end too.  COSSOCOSSOC has been releasing Cornish Pixies into the Hyak area.  I have no idea why.  Cornish Pixies are harmless pranksters.  Nonetheless, COSSOCOSSOC has been gathering them and sending them to you.  Be on the look out for sparkly stuff.  They like sparkles.  Report where you find it.  That might give us a clue.
<br><br>
Remember! Rapid detection, translation and dissemination of any intercepted messages is mission critical.  Exploration of new areas where COSSOCOSSOC may be operating is vital.  Report everything!  The team UP TOP should maintain CONSTANT VIGILANCE.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Week 3, The Harry Potter Adventure</h2>
This week, we received another letter from the head of Hogwarts, which the Freeheelers again delivered with a paper coffee cup port key.  Here it is.
<br><br>
<font size="4" face="Georgia, Arial" color="maroon">
Dear Professor Holmes,<br><br>
I'm SO sorry about the children being paralyzed by the basilisk.  However I see that your team is well-trained as they brought plastic party forks, which are of course reflective, and thus they did not actually look directly at the basilisk.  Thank goodness that your Little Nords intercepted the note from the organization we now know is the Conspiracy of Supreme Salvation of COSSOC, aka COSSOCOSSOC.  And brilliant that  you have an instructor who happens to read Norwegian and was able to send word up-top via Gray Jay so that the Little Nords knew to find and bring an antidote to Lakselv. What quick thinking by the Little Nords to recognize that the candy hearts from the house elves were actually an effective basilisk antidote.   However, I'm not sure they should be eating dragon you-know-what.  
<br>
This week continue to collect clues and intercept any notes that COSSOCOSSOC may be leaving.  Rapid detection, translation and dissemination of any intercepted messages is mission critical.  Exploration of new areas where COSSOCOSSOC may be operating is vital.  Report everything and I will pass on to Harry.
<br>
The team up top should maintain constant vigilance and be prepared for any and every thing.  Figuring out what COSSOCOSSOC is up to is our only hope.  We don't know why they opened the Crypt.
<br>

<br><br>
The big news is that this last week one group found a JOURNAL being kept by one of the COSSOCOSSOC members.  He (or she) is pretty low and 
pretty young, maybe 13?  He/she seems to have to do a lot of grunt work and is writing all about what happens.  It's a great source of information
so we put it back where the kids found it.  Hopefully our little diary-writer will write more so we can spy on COSSOCOSSOC.  Another group found
some more messages written in Norwegian about a 3-headed dog on the loose.  They sent word up top.
<br><br>The other big
news is that a bunch of Freeheelers were overcome by a rogue wizard and one of them was then controlled by the Imperius Curse.  The others were
in a desperate battle against the one under the Imperius Curse when the Little Nords were called to help!  Luckily some of the Little Nords have
read the Harry Potter books about 10 times each and did some homework on spells and brought wands.  Working together 5 of them, used the stupify,
expeliamus, and abducto spells to subdue the cursed Freeheelers.  More antidote from the house elves quickly revived the Freeheelers.
<br><br>
The kids found various signs of a 3-headed dog up top.  A leash.  Tracks in the snow.  But no 3-headed dog.  Hopefully he made it home...  Oh, and something
really weird happened.  There was a Viking wandering around up top saying 'Nokkel? Nokkel?'.  He/she/it didn't speak any English.  The kids tried
trading dragon jewels with it and got a strange green die and some Star Wars quotes.  Strange.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Week 2, The Harry Potter Adventure</h2>
Using an empty coffee cup port key, the Freeheelers delivered a message from head of Hogwarts.  The Hogwart's sister school Svinvorter needs 
the JNP's help.  The school was built over an ancient prison called the Crypt of Snow Snakes and Other Creatures (COSSOC).  Harry Potter is 
investigating a possible breach in COSSOC.  But he can't ski and is busy with other stuff.  He needs our help to investigate because it just
so happens that COSSOC was created by Snoqualm, an ancient magical being who lived in the Snoqualmie Pass a long, long time ago.  Snoqualm hid
COSSOC in the magical realm (in Northern Norway) but left many portals from Hyak so that it could check on the prison.<p><p>There was a second
page to the note which had a map but unfortunately the Freeheeler who had it got lost enroute, somehow.  The first task of the week was to find
the 2nd page.  Little Nords heading up top searched for clues and signs of "creatures".  The Freeheelers were also searching and ran into a 
basilisk.  Thankfully they had thought to bring plastic party forks which were reflective so they didn't actually look at the basilisk and were
just paralyzed.  The speedy Little Nords gave them antidote that the house elves had left for them.  Oh, in other news, lots of dragon eggs were found and a 
note written in Norwegian.<p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Week 1, The Harry Potter Adventure</h2>
On week 1, the teams began ski training in anticipation of being getting news from Hogwarts on a mission that would require their skiing and snoping expertise.  Kids were 
separated into teams, and the older kids were given special training because they might be required to take on special duties involving 'creatures'.
