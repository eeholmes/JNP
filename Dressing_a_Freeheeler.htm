Once your child is 10+ and are in Freeheelers (advanced groups), they are ready to start wearing lighter nordic specific clothing.  
This will help them work on their technique and not get hot while working hard.  If you buy nordic specific clothing, it will be expensive and you'll probably 
have to buy another set in 1-2 years.  However, many of the items are similar to what soccer players and bicyclists use so you'll
find them at thrift shops or you may already have this clothing from other sports your child does.  Most important is lighter pants that are snug at the ankles and lighter jackets.  See below for each layer of a junior nordic kit.</td>

  <p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>First the under
  layers.  The first layer is fairly thin.  Buy synthetic.&nbsp; No cotton.&nbsp; 
	You can get these at any outdoor store.  I buy my own kids underlayers at Value
	Village or Goodwill since you'll find these there for 1/3 the price.  On top of that you'll want to add a thin fleece, like 1/8th inch thick.  Again you can find lots of these used as thrift stores at low prices.  On warm days, skip the fleece on the legs and just use the thin underlayer on legs.</p>

  <p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>Add nordic or nordic-like ski
	pants.  These are more form-fitting and thinner than downhill, but need not be tights.
	If you buy new, then get one's that have a wind-resistant front.  These are expensive.  Soccer warm-up pants work fine as long as 
	they are synthetic.  Note these are not thin nylon pants; warm up pants are about 1/8in thick synthetic.  You can find these at thrift stores for under $20.  Make sure they
	are the type that are narrow at the ankles and have ankle zips.  NO COTTON and you don't want baggy pants.</p></br></br>

	This is thinner and more form-fitting than downhill and doesn't have a hood.
	Again these are pricey new, but sometimes you can find bicycling jackets at thrift stores that are
	similar. It doesn't have to be waterproof but wind resistant is important.</p>

  <p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>Rain jacket and rain/wind pants.  Get a light jacket and have it in the pack for windy/rainy days.  This is not a downhill jacket; that's too heavy.
	Rain/wind pants: You don't want anything too floppy.  Some form-fitting wind/rain pants are best. Most kids age 12+ won't need these except on really wet or cold days.</p>

  <p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>Now's the age for kids to start using thinner
	nordic gloves on warm days.  For cold days, do pack thicker downhill like gloves or thicker nordic-gloves or lobster gloves.  You'll need to buy nordic gloves new.  Confession: my kids didn't get nice nordic gloves until they were late teens because those gloves are very expensive and kids lose them.  Once they were ready for nordic-type gloves, they used those construction gloves (the ones that look like nordic gloves).  These cost about $10 and with a liner are warm enough.  I don't necessarily recommend this, but if your kids lose their gloves, this is a cheap back-up.</p>

  <p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>On cold days a thin 'puffy' jacket is really nice or you can use a thicker fleece jacket that fits under

	wind breaker front.  These can be hard to find used, but you can find them at thrift shops sometimes since they are used for bicycling too.</p>
